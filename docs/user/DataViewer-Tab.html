The data      viewer is based on plot panels, which can be added to the view and then      configured.</p>    <p><img src="../img/1.jpeg" alt="example view" /><br />      Figure 1: Example data viewer layout</p>    <h2>View Panels:</h2>    <p>A panel is the the frame around the enclosed axes. Panel options can be      changed by right-click on the panel frame (outside the plotting axes). The      panel options context menu will only show, if all plot view options (Zoom,      Pan, ...) are disabled (Arrow button). The currently active panel is      indicated by a cyan frame. Change the active panel by left-click onto      another panel.A single panel can be deleted from the panel context menu.</p>    <p>The default panel is a time-plot, which creates plotting axes to      visualise one or more data channels against time. Other panel types      available are map-plot, correlation-plot and spectrum-plot. Some plot      types require a link to an existing time-plot, where the data of the      time-plot is used as the data source for the secondary plot. Changes to      the time-plot content are then automatically reflected in the secondary      plot. The linking procedure works by selecting a new plot option from a      panel context menu, and then left-clicking into the desired, existing      time-plot panel. Once linked, the panel frame colours change to indicate      the link, as show in Figure (1) on the right.</p>    <h3>Add plot/panel:</h3>    <p>Creates a new plot panel at the bottom of the current column ( the column      with the active panel ). The new panel defaults to time-plot.</p>    <h3>Add column:</h3>    <p>Creates a new panel column on the right with a new plot panel inside. The      new plot panel becomes the new active panel.</p>    <h3>Clear:</h3>    <p>Deletes all plot panels except for the top left panel.</p>    <p><br />    </p>    <h2>Plot Types:</h2>    <p>The plots itself can be configured by right-click inside the axes, where      the options vary between the plot types.</p>    <h3>Time-plot</h3>    <h3>Map-plot</h3>    <h3>Spectrum-plot</h3>    <h3>Correlation-plot</h3>    <span style="color: #838383;"></span><span style="color: #838383;"></span>  </body></html>
